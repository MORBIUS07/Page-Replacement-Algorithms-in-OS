# Page-Replacement-Algorithms-in-OS
 In memory management, page replacement is key when a page fault occurs. If no free memory is available, a page replacement algorithm like Optimal, FIFO, or LRU is used to replace a page, storing the removed one on disk. This ensures required pages are in memory for process continuation (Tanenbaum, 2008).
